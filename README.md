# Icons by HERE Technologies

This is the source repository for the official icon set from HERE Technologies.

The icons are designed under the HERE design guidelines.

## Introduction

At HERE we differentiate between UI icons and carto icons. 
 
UI icons are included in our product iconography sets. These icons are used to enhance the user interface of our products. UI icons can be used together with other UI elements to make the content easier to understand. 

Carto icons are part of the map iconography set. Carto icons are used exclusively on our maps. They are the  icons you can see when browsing the map and looking at points of interests (POI) embedded in the map data. These icons are optimized for the display on a map and therefore shouldn’t be used in other contexts. 

## Point of Interest

Whenever a place is displayed on a map, the Places Category System defines which carto icon is representing it.  

POI icons follows the primary category system used for HERE Map Content places. Read the [developer guide](https://docs.in.here.com/static/24675/250052/html/topics-places/places-category-system-full.html) on how to use the category system in your project.

The assignment (available as excel cvs and jason file) of the icons and colors to the categories are delivered with the respective map style. 

If there are no icon or colors defined for a specific type of place, the system is falling back to the next higher up category. If there is no information for that category either, a generic icon and color are used instead. 
 

## Icon sizes 
 
The icons’ default size is 24px. Wherever suitable, please use icons in their default size - they were designed for it and will look its best.  

Sometimes you will need to change the icon size for your context. To ensure that icons look high quality when they are scaled up or down, we recommend you changing the icon size either to 12px, 16px, 24px or 48px. Our designers are already working on pixel-perfect icons optimized for low-resolution screens.
