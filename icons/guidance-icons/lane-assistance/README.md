# Lane Assistance

The HERE SDK provides lane recommendations to help drivers stay on the route. For more information, refer to the developer documentation:

[Lane Guidance - HERE SDK](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/sdk-for-android-navigate-developer-guide/page/topics/navigation-lane-guidance.html)

## Lanes

Include icons to indicate specific lane types. For more details, see the API reference:

[Lane Types - HERE SDK](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/sdk-for-android-navigate-api-reference/page/com/here/sdk/navigation/LaneType.html)

## Dividers

Include icons for lane dividers.

## Directions

The "Direction" folder contains all icons required for lane assistance. It refers to the direction of the arrow displayed on a sign or road marking for a specific lane. There are two sets. To define how to combine direction icons, itâ€™s important to understand how the system displays combinations (Direction Category Value) and how each direction variation is structured (Direction Category Icons Structure).

[Lane Direction Categories - HERE SDK](https://www.here.com/docs/bundle/sdk-for-android-navigate-api-reference/page/com/here/sdk/navigation/LaneDirectionCategory.html)

### Set 1 - Single direction per lane

Set 1 is used when only a single direction needs to be displayed for a specific lane in the Lane Assistance component.

### Set 2 - Multiple directions per lane

To display multiple directions, use the icons included in Set 2.
