# Contributing

The team behind the [HERE Icon Library](https://github.com/heremaps/here-icons) gratefully accepts contributions via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) filed against the
[GitHub project](https://github.com/heremaps/here-icons/pulls).

## Signing each Commit

When you file a pull request, we ask that you sign off the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) in each commit.
Any Pull Request with commits that are not signed off will be rejected by the
[DCO check](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/).

A DCO is a lightweight way to confirm that a contributor wrote or otherwise has the right
to submit code or documentation to a project. Simply add `Signed-off-by` as shown in the example below
to indicate that you agree with the DCO.

The git flag `-s` can be used to sign a commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m 'README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake'
```

The result is a signed commit message:

```
README.md: Fix minor spelling mistake
